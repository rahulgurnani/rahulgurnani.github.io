Graduated from IIT KGP in 2016. Since then, I have been working as a Software Engineer. I like to read and discuss new algorithms and architecture patterns in code.

I like to my spend my spare time in learning/playing music (keyboard and vocals), reading books and fixing machines/things around me.
